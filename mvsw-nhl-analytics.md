## Searching for Extra Skater

> From -- Aug 8th #mvsw 

Jeff and Greg discuss the implications of analytics on fans and the hockey community.  

#### Shownotes: 

Greg and Jeff speculate that web sites like Extra Skater and Cap Geek are doing favours for the NHL.

That Jon Collins views NHL analytics as avenue to attract more, and new fans.

As "another entry point, another way to tell a story".

"The moment the wave crests on analytics, when NHL.com has drop down menu."

Marek: NHL is handing money away to Extra skater and Cap Geek by not having NHL.com section for adv stats.

Marek "How do we turn these numbers into stories.   How do we get this stuff to work on TV?"
