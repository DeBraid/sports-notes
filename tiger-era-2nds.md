## Tiger Era: Who Had the Most Runner-Ups?

>  List of [major wins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods#Wins_.2814.29) by Tiger Woods

Fascinating that of all the great and memorable PGA Tour pros from Tiger Era, it was Chris DiMarco who most frequently finished as runner-up in majors to Tiger.

Twice DiMarco was a close 2nd to Tiger in the mid 2000's: Masters 2005 playoff, Open 2006 by 2 strokes. 

Ernie Els also has 2 runner-ups but in blowout victories by Woods.  During 2000, the US Open was won by Tiger in a 15-stroke rout of the field.  A few weeks later Tiger again dominated to win Open Championship by 8-strokes. 

Funny that not Sergio, nor Phil, Duvall or Davis Love, but Chris DiMarco was thrown shade by the giant shadow cast by Woods.  With two solo second-place finishes, but an aggregate margin of only 2 strokes, Chris DiMarco can make the case as the greatest victim of Tiger Era.
